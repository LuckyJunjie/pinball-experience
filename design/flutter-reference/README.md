# Flutter reference

**Document ID:** (folder index)

This folder centralizes all **Flutter I/O Pinball** reference material. The game (Godot) replicates the same functions and design as the open-source [I/O Pinball](https://github.com/google/pinball) (Flutter + Forge2D, Google I/O 2022). These docs are for reference only; implementation is in Godot.
